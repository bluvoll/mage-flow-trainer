"""Subprocess launching for the GUI.

`ProcessRunner` is vendored from Aozora Trainer (Apache-2.0) with the Windows-only branches kept
intact; the launch specs below are ours.

The GUI never imports the trainer -- it spawns it and reads stdout. That is what keeps a crashing
run from taking the window down with it, and it is why a torch/CUDA import never happens in the Qt
process.
