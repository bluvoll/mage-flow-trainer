"""TOML <-> GUI bridge.

Ours, not Aozora's. Two decisions carry the whole module.

**Widgets are keyed by dotted TOML path** (`flow.hf_scale`, `dataset.caption.tag_dropout_percent`)
rather than by an invented flat name space. There is then no rename table to drift: a key either
exists in the dataclasses or it does not, and `missing_ui_keys()` turns that into an assertion the
gate can run.

**Only non-default values are written.** Defaults come from the dataclasses themselves, so a
GUI-written TOML reads like a hand-written one -- and, more importantly, a field whose default
changes later is not silently pinned to the old value by every config the GUI ever saved.

Everything is validated by `trainer.training.config.load_config`, the same function the trainer
calls. The GUI does not reimplement a single rule; it shows you the error the trainer would raise.
