    toward early segments (0 = equal lengths), which stretches the high-LR region and then
    compresses the tail, and `local_d` reshapes the descent inside each segment. At the defaults
    the result tracks REX early and pulls below it after the midpoint (mean multiplier over a
    1000-step run: REX 0.83, ReREX 0.76, cosine 0.50).
