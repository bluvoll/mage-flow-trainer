"""Texture-crop training: canvas-sized crops chosen by image content.

Ported from TrainTrain (`trainer/dataset.py`, the `texture_source` branch). The idea: instead of
training on the whole image resized down to a bucket, crop a canvas-sized region **at native pixel
scale** out of the source, pick the region by detail content, and supervise only a feathered
sub-region of it while the rest conditions the forward pass as real context.

Three things about the reference implementation are worth knowing, because two of them are
reproduced only on request.

**It black-pads.** `image.crop()` beyond the image bounds is not an error in PIL -- it fills with
zeros. The reference computes `max_sx = max(0, image.width - canvas_w)` and crops anyway, so any
image smaller than the chosen canvas yields a crop with a black band. Measured on one texture
dataset this fires for 36-43% of images at the square canvases and 83% at `1536x640`, and since the
reference fixes one canvas per epoch it happens for whole epochs at a time. `oversize` selects the
behaviour: `"pad"` reproduces it (for validating a port against an existing checkpoint), `"cover"`
scales the image up to cover the canvas before cropping, `"skip"` drops the image for that batch.

**Crop freedom depends entirely on source resolution**, and it is not a detail -- it is whether the
technique does anything at all. Measured median "tightest slack" (the smaller of the two spare
dimensions) for a 1024x1024 canvas: **1001px on a mixed set** (median 4.4MP sources) against **176px on
the texture set** (median 1.2MP). `describe_feasibility` reports this at startup so a run that cannot
crop says so instead of looking like it worked.

**Selection is a greedy hill-climb in the reference** -- up to 10 random candidates, each scored
with a full-canvas Laplacian, accepting the first above threshold. Here the energy map is computed
once per image at 1/8 scale (~64x cheaper) and crop positions are *sampled proportional to* energy,
which removes the first-candidate bias and has no rejection loop.

    # --- the oversize cascade ---------------------------------------------------------------
    # `oversize` above is the last rung. The four switches here run before it, and all four are ON
    # by default. Setting them to (False, 1.0, "black", False) is byte-identical to the trainer as
    # it stood before they existed -- verified over 200 trials across 5 canvases and random source
    # sizes, 200/200 identical crops -- and `configs/reference_pad.toml` is exactly that.
    #
    # Why: blind canvas selection pads 56% of draws on one texture set, and a black band at that rate is
    # learnable -- a padded run emitted a black bar across the bottom of roughly 1 in 50
    # generations. The cascade takes crops needing invented pixels from 58.4% to 0.7%, and black
    # pixels from 11.6% to 0.4%.
    #
    # These defaults were reverted once and then restored, which is worth recording because the
    # reason was a measurement error, not a change of opinion. The first cascade run had visibly
    # broken anatomy and was blamed on `fit_aware` below. It was actually run under DDP, while its
    # pad baseline was single-GPU -- so the comparison measured DDP, not the cascade. A DDP run
    # with the cascade OFF reproduced the same damage, and a single-GPU cascade run at the full
    # 1239 steps was better than the pad baseline (and overfits somewhat sooner, consistent with
    # the model no longer spending capacity on black bands). See the DDP warning in
    # `train.py::_report`.

    # Rung 1, and the one that does nearly all the work. Draws the canvas from those the source can
    # hold, instead of drawing blind and forcing the fit: 58.4% -> 0.7% of crops needing invented
    # pixels on that set, with no upscaling, because 99% of that dataset fits some canvas.
    # It is also the largest behavioural change of the four -- the canvas mix stops being the
    # preset's flat weighting and follows the dataset's own shapes (1024x1024 40%, 832x1216 37%,
    # 1216x832 11%, 640x1536 9%, 1536x640 2%), so the extreme aspects get rarer. That was the
