"""Dataset and aspect-ratio batch sampler.

Every sample in a batch must share a bucket -- latents of different shapes cannot be stacked -- so
batching is bucket-first: the sampler groups indices by bucket, then yields fixed-size batches
from within each bucket.

Per-bucket micro-batch sizes are supported because cost is not linear in resolution. Attention is
O(tokens^2), and tokens = W*H/256, so a 1536px bucket costs roughly 5x a 1024px one. A single
global batch size either wastes VRAM at low resolution or OOMs at high.

    `batch_size` is an int, or a map keyed by **resolution tier** -- the values in
    `dataset.resolutions` (or the single `dataset.resolution`), matched exactly:

        resolutions = [768, 1024, 1280]
        batch_size  = { 768 = 16, 1024 = 12, 1280 = 8 }

    Keyed on the tier, not on the bucket's longest side, because the tier is what predicts cost and
    the longest side is not. Bucketing targets a constant *area*, so `tier^2 / 256` is an exact
    upper bound on a tier's token count (measured on a mixed set: tiers 768/1024/1280 top out at exactly
    2304/4096/6400 tokens) while the longest side ranges overlap almost completely across tiers --
    704-1280 at tier 768 against 768-1792 at tier 1024. Sorting by longest side therefore sorts by
    something that is not the cost.

    This used to be a threshold lookup on `max(bucket)`, where each key was a floor covering
    everything up to the next one. That reads like a label and behaves like a range: `{512: 32,
    1024: 12}` silently gave a 960x960 bucket 32 images -- 2.4x the load of the 1024x1024 bucket
    next to it, and an OOM several minutes into a run. Exact tier matching cannot express that, and
    `load_config` rejects a key that is not a declared tier.

    A bucket can host more than one tier (two different sources can land on the same bucket from
    different tiers). Cost depends only on the bucket, so any of their sizes would do; the largest
    tier present wins, which is the smaller batch and therefore the safe direction.

    **This sampler is rank-agnostic on purpose.** `accelerator.prepare(dataloader)` wraps the batch
    sampler in Accelerate's `BatchSamplerShard`, which hands whole batches to each rank round-robin
    and pads with `even_batches` so ranks stay in lockstep. Because it distributes *whole* batches
    it preserves bucket homogeneity, so there is nothing for us to add. Sharding here as well would
    shard twice -- each rank would see roughly 1/world_size^2 of the data, which shows up only as a
    quietly reduced step count rather than an error.
