"""Post-install smoke check, shared by install.sh and install.bat.

Deliberately imports rather than reading version metadata: a package can be pip-installed and still
fail to import, and torch with the wrong CUDA build imports fine but reports no devices. Both are
things you want to hear about now rather than several minutes into the first run.

Run directly with the installed interpreter -- it must not import anything from `mageflow` itself, so
that a broken trainer still produces a readable dependency report:

    venv/bin/python -m trainer.tools.check_install
