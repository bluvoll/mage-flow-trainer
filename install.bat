rem identical pinned set (torch ships cp312/cp313 win_amd64 wheels, and triton-windows publishes
rem cp311/cp312/cp313) and pass the CPU gates, but nothing has been trained on either, so they are
rem fallbacks rather than peers. Call order below IS the preference order.
rem Written as subroutine calls rather than nested for/if/&& blocks on purpose: cmd parses a whole
